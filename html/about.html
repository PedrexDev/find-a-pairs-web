                <p>Aumb is another Discord bot that can do what the other 10,000 bots do. But it has quite an interesting story.</p>
                <p>Aumb's whole story begins in 2021, when my first bot, Blooby, was created. But Blooby ended pretty quickly because at that time I wasn't ready to create something of my own, Blooby was more or less a skid of about 18 bots from GitHub. So I hit it off with him, but I have good memories of those times. At the end of 2021, one of my (probably) former friends gave me the idea to make a bot that would be focused only on the economy. And so I started working. I made the bot for about 2 months (the last month was just catching up on mistakes and optimization). Some of you may still remember him, his name was Avalon. I don't remember exactly, but the name of the shoe was inspired by someone from a discussion forum, it was also called Avalon and I just liked the name. The bot was "fairly" successful, it was on +- 40 servers, but then the growth stopped. Due to the ban of my main account on Top.GG, where I wanted to graduate the bot, I had to change the whole application in the Developer Portal, because simply transferring that application or that team would not work. I last worked on the bot on June 6, 2022, that was the last day before I took it off the VPS. After two months, in August, I came up with the idea to make another bot, this time a bot that could do more than just economy (I still couldn't compete when there are bots like Dank Memer on the scene with several times better economy system than the primitive Avalon). After thinking about how to name him, I finally named him Aumb. It stands for Another Useless Moderation Bot. It shouldn't be "useless" there, but it looks better. Until now, I work on the bot day by day and develop it better and better. That's why just adding Aumb to your Discord server or following Aumb on Instagram will make me incredibly happy and also help immensely in the development of this bot.</p>
